Traditional image processing technologies include image convolution (Gabor convolution, etc.), edge detection, multi-scale representation (image pyramid), image segmentation, feature point matching, target detection, etc. these technologies also play an important role in deep learning. This repository implements these image processing technologies through MATLAB to help understand the underlying principles.
